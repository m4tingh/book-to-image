 two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon,
assume command of the farm. they adopt
seven commandments of animal-ism, the most important
of which is, "All animals are equal"
the animals revolt and drive the drunken
and irresponsible Mr Jones from the farm,
renaming it "Animal Farm" the farm runs
smoothly, and the animals elevate themselves to
positions of leadership.
