 old major, the old boar on
the Manor Farm, calls the animals for
a meeting. he compares the humans to
parasites and teaches the animals a revolutionary
song. as the pigs become more human,
they become more 'human' and 'four legs
good, two legs better' the animals' efforts
are replaced by the maxims, "All animals
are equal, but some animals are more
equal than others"
